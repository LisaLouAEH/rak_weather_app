This Small project is my first one with react.  
  
  
## How to use it ?  
In the project directory, you can run:

Will install the App dependancies noticed in the package.json   
  
##### `npm start`  
  
Runs the app in the development mode.<br>  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
